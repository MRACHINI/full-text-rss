<title>Google Pixel Buds: What I learned in my first afternoon with the headphones</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/7QhNiRtjrQ8/google-pixel-buds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/7QhNiRtjrQ8/google-pixel-buds</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Can these headphones really be worth $159?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's Pixel Buds were one of the more ... under-the-radar announcements back at Google's October hardware launch event. What with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2&quot;&gt;Pixel 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook&quot;&gt;Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home-mini&quot;&gt;Home Mini&lt;/a&gt;, Home Max and new services, a pair of Bluetooth earbuds kind of got lost in the shuffle. But now the short-supplied wireless headphones are shipping to reviewers and some early buyers alike, and I have a pair in my ears right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used the Pixel Buds for just an afternoon, but here's what I'm finding about them so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.google.com/product/google_pixel_buds&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at Google Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fit is comfortable, but has trade-offs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/google-pixel-buds-in-ears-profile.jpg?itok=WDfiyKsS&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Google Pixel Buds&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design and fit of the Pixel Buds will only truly be familiar to those of us who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-glass&quot;&gt;had Google Glass&lt;/a&gt; with the optional earbud attachment. It's a very similar design, with a shallow hard plastic earbud and a bit of a cord that's used to form a loop to keep the bud in your ear. It's designed this way because the earbud itself doesn't have the typical soft rubber tip that goes deep in your ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right pull big&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily the most comfortable wireless earbuds I've used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core feature of this design is comfort — these are easily the most comfortable wireless &quot;earbuds&quot; I've ever placed in my ear. If it weren't for the cord dangling on the back of my neck, I would forget they're in my ears — yes, they're THAT comfortable. Part of that is the super light weight of the buds, but also how they sit in your ear rather than jamming down inside. The cord loop is difficult to adjust and it takes a while to figure out the &quot;right&quot; fit in your ear (with awkward time spent in front of a mirror) but just like any other pair of earbuds I think I will be able to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of that coin, the Pixel Buds have almost no sound isolation. Because there's no rubber &quot;tip&quot; that goes into your ear to seal out the outside world, you still hear most everything around you. For someone riding a bike down a busy street that's probably a good thing, but if you're sitting in a cafe and want to concentrate it'll be annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sound quality is surprisingly good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are headphones, after all, so here are my quick thoughts on sound quality. My initial take is that it's surprisingly good. Even with a general lack of sound isolation letting in lots of noise from your environment, you can get a good range of sound and even a little bit of bass out of these tiny buds. They get louder than I'd ever want for my hearing's sake, but that lack of noise isolation also means that there's a higher chance you'll be turning the volume up a bit higher — not great for your ears, or for the people sitting next to you on the train who probably don't care about your music choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they as good as wired earbuds of the same size and cost? Nope. But they're definitely better than what I experienced with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-gear-iconx-2018&quot;&gt;Gear IconX 2018 earbuds&lt;/a&gt; and are on par with larger &quot;neckbud&quot; type headphones I've used in the past. That's pretty good for a relatively tiny pair of headphones, and will be good enough for most people — even if they don't necessarily give you amazing quality for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bluetooth 'Fast Pair' is amazing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/google-pixel-buds-unboxed.jpg?itok=i9_nwdWJ&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;Google Pixel Buds&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't something that's specific to the Pixel Buds — you'll find it on all &quot;made for Google&quot; headphones — but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/10/announcing-fast-pair-effortless.html&quot;&gt;new Bluetooth Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic. Open the Pixel Buds case, unlock your phone, and with a tap you're paired. It's absolutely wonderful, and it removes one of the biggest pain points of Bluetooth audio devices today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that this gets adopted across the industry and makes its way down to the inexpensive headphones out there and doesn't remain a high-end feature, because everyone should be able to experience this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as good a place as any to remind you that the Pixel Buds are only designed to work with Pixel phones (either generation), at least when it comes to the advanced features. Google could definitely expand this further in the future, but it support documentation right now only talks about the Pixels when it comes to Fast Pair, Assistant and Google Translate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Assistant is FAST ... and needs some polish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these aren't the only proper &quot;Google Assistant headphones,&quot; this is my first experience with the feature — and consider me super impressed. Rather than using &quot;OK, Google&quot; detection, the Pixel Buds trigger Assistant by pressing and holding on the right earbud (yes, only the right one) to speak the command. Lift off of the earbud, and it finishes taking your input and does what you asked it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Screenshot_20171110-125304_0.jpg?itok=1uQ473TC&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1600&quot; alt=&quot;Google Assistant on Pixel Buds&quot; class=&quot;right lightbox&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's absolutely &lt;strong&gt;ridiculous&lt;/strong&gt; how fast this is working when connected to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2&quot;&gt;my Pixel 2 XL&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the speed really comes from the fact that the Pixel Buds don't have to guess when you're done talking — as soon as you lift off of the earbuds, it knows you're done an is ready to give you information back through the earbuds. But the responses come super quickly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue, as ever with Assistant, is what it can &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do and how it fails. As we've &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home&quot;&gt;experienced with Google Home&lt;/a&gt;, it's tough to deal with a voice-only interface when things go wrong. Multiple times the Pixel Buds gave me a confirmation-type sound after speaking, only to do absolutely nothing. Rephrasing my question or retrying, it'd hear me and perform the action. Other actions, like &quot;skip forward 30 seconds&quot; while listening to a podcast work, but often didn't resume playback after doing so. Saying &quot;walking directions to X&quot; pulls up the directions on my phone, but doesn't give me step-by-step guidance in the earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google's list of suggested Assistant actions for the Pixel Buds is basically the same set of things you'd normally do with your phone, and that's totally fine. But it's how those things are manifested in an audio-only interface rather than on a screen that looks like it needs a little work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I'm probably going to turn off notifications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this Assistant-type functionality, the Pixel Buds also feed notifications from your phone into your ears. Rather than just send you the sound, it also gives you extra information, including the app that sent the notification and if applicable &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; sent it. It's useful the first couple of times, and being able to double tap the right earbud to read the notification aloud and then also reply via voice is very cool in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;left pull big&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just takes too damn long to manage notifications through voice and taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But considering the number of notifications I get, I'm likely going to be turning off this feature until I'm in a situation where I can't actively look at my phone. Having my podcast or music paused for 5 to 10 seconds so I can try to tap and speak to manage a message in my earbuds just isn't worth it to me. And with dozens of notifications coming in every hour, I'm going to be spending a large amount of time managing things rather than concentrating on what I'm actually listening to — the whole reason I have headphones on in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could easily be fixed by giving control over which notifications come through to the earbuds, but right now the Pixel Buds don't offer that. It's all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A fabric charging case?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the Apple AirPods and Samsung Gear IconX 2018 earbuds, the charging case is a big part of the experience of the Pixel Buds — with 5 hours of charge, you need to let the buds sleep in this case and charge back up again periodically. Google loves fabric right now. Look at the Daydream View, Google Homes or new line of Pixel 2 cases — they're all fabric. The same type of stuff makes up the Pixel Buds case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;right pull big&quot; readability=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is fine — but what will it look like after several months of daily use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case looks nice. The fabric on the outside and soft rubber on the inside are very friendly and easy to get acquainted with. But I have serious concerns about the longterm durability of something that is this soft. The only real structure to the case is around the bottom surrounding the battery (makes sense) but the lid is simply hinged fabric and rubber and the edges are very flexible. Normally I wouldn't be super worried about these sorts of things, but the Pixel Buds charging case is designed to be with you all of the time — in your pocket, in your bag, on the table — and I'm not sure how it'll handle that every day for months on end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case's functions are all just fine. There are strong magnets that suck the L and R buds into place for charging, and a handy diagram sticker inside shows you how to wrap the cord around (though I doubt people will hold to this, and that may create some problems with the cord down the road). Three LEDs show the charging state of the case itself, and pressing a button shows the charge state of the buds that are inserted. The case provides &quot;24 hours&quot; of charge for the buds, and charges over USB-C — yes, it can even charge off of a Pixel 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TBD — voice translation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final fun part of the Pixel Buds — and their one true differentiator — is the promise of real-time language translation via Google Translate. Not expecting my Pixel Buds to show up today I don't have the means to test this just yet, but I plan to. I have already lowered my expectations, understanding that it can't possibly consistently work in the same seamless way as Google's demo on stage in October, but I'm cautiously optimistic after seeing how quickly Assistant works for other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Google has figured out how to get the latency down, and deal with ambient noise (the big issue) it could be a fantastic tool. We know the core Google Translate experience is good, but the rest of it has to be perfect or it's going to get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it for now — let us know in the comments what else you want to know about the Pixel Buds and we'll do our best to answer!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds — How to get all the awesome new equipment</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/iqIc03vmM6A/how-get-awesome-new-equipment-horizon-zero-dawn-frozen-wilds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/iqIc03vmM6A/how-get-awesome-new-equipment-horizon-zero-dawn-frozen-wilds</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Questing for Bluegleam is the way to new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/addons/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds/cid=UP9000-CUSA01967_00-HZTHEFROZENWILDS&quot;&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/a&gt; was a breakout hit for PlayStation 4 when it was released earlier in 2017, and now the first —and possibly only — expansion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/horizon-zero-dawn-frozen-wilds&quot;&gt;The Frozen Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, is available. Traveling up into the Banuk region of The Cut gives you new story to explore, machines to kill and loot, and of course, some awesome new weapons and outfits. You'll need more than just metal shard and machine components to pick these up though, and we've got the details on how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/addons/horizon-zero-dawn-the-frozen-wilds/cid=UP9000-CUSA01967_00-HZTHEFROZENWILDS&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quests are your friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/hzd-frozen-wilds-quest.jpg?itok=NkRUIvNf&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've made it to the first settlement inside of Banuk lands, and gotten through the cinematic, you'll see a trader nearby. You can sell him any extra gear you have cluttering up your inventory, but it's what he's holding on to that ought to really get your fingers itching. There are several new outfits, as well as three new bows for you to add to your inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a catch. Even if you roll up with all the shards and components in existence, you still won't have what you need to purchase this new equipment. That's because it requires a new resource: Bluegleam. Bluegleam grows on the bodies of the oldest machines, but the way that you'll acquire it in-game is by completing quests or finding natural reservoirs of the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quests will offer Bluegeam as a reward, and depending on the quest you can snag between one and seven as a reward. Of course, each bow sold by the Banuk is fairly pricey in Bluegleam alone, starting at 12 and moving up from there. While you can get a decent start by completing quests as quickly as possible, there is also another way to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bluegleam deposits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/hzd-frozen-wilds-bluegleam%20copy.jpg?itok=CBNGpy1O&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a specialty trader up on the side of the mountain who will trade you maps of collectibles — including a Bluegleam deposit map — so long as you bring her what she needs. In the case of the map we're talking about, you'll need a goatskin, and a badger bone in order to make the trade. Thankfully both of these animals are pretty common this far up the mountain, so it shouldn't take long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've acquired the map, you'll be able to see the deposits where Bluegleam is hiding out in the wild. Much like collectibles from the main game, you'll get a general area on the map and then need to use your focus to identify it and harvest what you can. Since there is only a limited amount of Bluegleam to be acquired from quests, if you want every new piece of equipment you're gonna need to hunt down a significant amount of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A special quest for to modify your spear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/hzd-frozen-wilds-drone-hangar%20copy.jpg?itok=gY0vRiF3&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can find new outfits and some sweet new bows from Traders, there is also a way to modify your spear. Yes, even if you're playing after beating the game. This quest, called A Secret Shared, will send you to the very top of the map to go hunting through an old drone hangar looking for a specific part. You need to find a rail that can be attached to your spear, allowing it to enjoy the glory of modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a quest that will let you finally modify your spear, making it far more dangerous than it had been up until this point. You'll have to delve down and into the hangar to find a rail inside a drone, the point of this quest. Once you return to Song Edge and speak to Kamut, the character who sent you on this quest, you'll be able to modify your spear for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the new equipment worth the wait?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/hzd-frozen-wilds-weapons.jpg?itok=LimvjENT&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frozen Wilds are a savage place. With new machines more powerful than the corrupted ones you've seen down south, having the right weapons to get the job done are absolutely critical. While none of the new weapons are particularly easy to snag, they are well worth every piece of Bluegleam that you pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These weapons are built to take down the nasty new machines running amok, and even playing at level 47 they made a huge difference compared to the weapons that were already in our inventory. It's the outfits that become a bit more complicated. Depending on when you take on the Frozen Wilds, they may, or may not be worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, if you've already gotten Aloy the Shield Weaver armor found in a bunker in the main game, then you really don't need to worry about picking up any other outfits. Those other outfits are solid, they just don't hold a candle to the capabilities that Shield Weaver has. It is, after all, the ultimate armor, and requires some serious work on your end to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you playing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/hzd-frozen-wilds-conclusion.jpg?itok=RZctAyqz&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn: The Frozen Wilds delivers an excellent expansion to an already spectacular game, and gives players plenty to do there. With new bows to shoot those machines from a distance, the ability to modify your spear for the first time, and some swanky new outfits to acquire, there is plenty of new equipment to feast your eyes on. So are you playing The Frozen Wilds? Let us know in the comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This SanDisk Ultra 128GB microSDXC card is down to $29.99 on Amazon. This card normally sells around $45. This is a price-match from Best Buy, part of an early Black Friday deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about 128GB is you don't really have to worry about having spare SD cards if you're the sort of person who shoots a lot of high quality photos or does a lot of video recording. This thing works great to extend the storage life of a phone or security camera, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've been looking to get into the whole smart home lighting game, and have yet to make the move because of price, this offer may be the best one out there. This Starter Kit comes with four white bulbs and the hub that's required for them to work all for just $59.98. This price is available at both Amazon and Best Buy right now. Normally, this kit runs $99.99, and at this price it's only $1 more than the 2-bulb Starter Kit is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Orbit B-hyve 12-station smart sprinkler system controller is also on sale for $82.99. It regularly sells right around $120. It has seen a few drops close to $90 but those have all been temporary and never as low as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the Rachio sprinkler controller, which is the market leader for these sort of devices. An 8-zone Rachio is $200. You're getting a lot more value from the Orbit with 6 stations for $69. The Orbit has 4.5 stars based on 765 user reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Pixelbook will soon do split-screen multitasking in tablet mode</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/JlsEuyCz50U/pixelbook-will-soon-do-split-screen-multitasking-tablet-mode</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/JlsEuyCz50U/pixelbook-will-soon-do-split-screen-multitasking-tablet-mode</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Your Pixelbook's about to get a lot more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got the spare $1000 to spend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook&quot;&gt;Google's Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt; currently offers the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixelbook-review&quot;&gt;absolute best Chrome OS experience you can find&lt;/a&gt;. However, that doesn't mean the device is without its issues. One area of aggravation lies with Chrome OS's inability to properly multitask when in tablet mode, but thanks to the latest updated in Chrome OS 64, this is finally changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/10/Pixelbook-Design-7_0.jpg?itok=jvcZ1hkq&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovered by Googler and Chrome fanatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+FrancoisBeaufort/posts/i9MusuHbqJ5&quot;&gt;François Beaufort&lt;/a&gt;, Split View multitasking can now be enabled in tablet mode by enabling a flag within the Dev Channel for Chrome OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flag is labeled as &lt;em&gt;chrome://flags/#enable-tablet-splitview&lt;/em&gt;, and once turned on, you'll be able to tap on the overview icon to see which windows are open and then move them to either side to snap them in place and run two tabs of Chrome on the screen at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Split View in tablet mode currently only works with the Chrome browser, meaning that you still can't run two Android apps side-by-side when using your Pixelbook as a tablet. That's undoubtedly disappointing, but even so, this is a big step in the right direction for where Chrome OS needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Pixelbook-Tablet-Mode-Split-View-Multitasking_0.jpg?itok=DYN9sQX4&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Split View in tablet mode on a Pixelbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no ETA for when this feature will be available to use without having to enable the developer flag, but our guess is that it'll be here soon. Keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Best Cases for the OnePlus 5</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/G4QATGZvlus/best-cases-oneplus-5</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/G4QATGZvlus/best-cases-oneplus-5</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Keep your OnePlus 5 protected in a case!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only a few months on the market, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5&quot;&gt;OnePlus 5&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5t&quot;&gt;a sequel&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn't mean it's still not worth protecting if you have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're hoping to keep your OnePlus 5 in immaculate condition, your best bet is a quality case. Thankfully, both OnePlus itself and a number of well-known accessory makers have made cases available for the &quot;flagship killer,&quot; so let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OnePlus protective cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/06/oneplus-5-sandstone-cover-press.jpg?itok=nYcixND3&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; height=&quot;934&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you bought your phone through the OnePlus website, you would have seen some of what it has to offer for OnePlus 5. As expected, you can buy some pretty cool style swap covers, which are shell cases designed by OnePlus, available in Sandstone, Ebony Wood, Carbon Fiber, and Rosewood finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are super slim cases that add little bulk to your phone, offering just enough around back to level off the camera bump. The wood cases are backed with a layer of Kevlar, the Karbon is all Kevlar, and the Sandstone case is made of reliable PC plastic. They come in at $20 for Sandstone, and $25 for the wood varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oneplus.net/store&quot;&gt;OnePlus accessories page&lt;/a&gt; to find some cases that are bundled with earbuds, screen protectors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oneplus.net/oneplus-5-protective-case&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Otterbox Achiever Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/06/oneplus-5-otterbox-press.jpg?itok=m6l8suI-&quot; width=&quot;532&quot; height=&quot;914&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OnePlus is also offering an Otterbox case through its website. If you know your phone needs a bit of added protection &lt;em&gt;from yourself&lt;/em&gt;, the rugged two-piece design here will fit the bill. And at $30, it's actually cheaper than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-ACHIEVER-Case-OnePlus-Packaging/dp/B0714QBBWZ/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61559&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;getting it from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and it won't break the bank too badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's actually got a pretty unique construction from other Otterbox cases, with stylish cutouts on the PC shell around the bottom. This look &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; shines with the red and black color option, with the black TPU cutting through the red shell for a nice effect. For a slim yet rugged case from a trusted brand, you can't go wrong with this Otterbox case for the OnePlus 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://oneplus.net/otterbox-case-for-oneplus-5&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot;&gt;See at OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spigen Ultra Hybrid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Spigen-ultra-hybrid-oneplus-5-press_0.jpg?itok=nEMOTCnE&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you're looking for a slim clear case for your OnePlus 5, you should consider the Spigen Ultra Hybrid. Spigen is one of the accessory brands we've come to trust as no matter how slim they manage to make their cases they still manage to offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Ultra Hybrid, you get Spigen's Air Cushion technology in the corner which helps to reinforce the case where it needs it most. There are precise cutouts around the ports and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get yours for just $13!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-OnePlus-Cushion-Technology-Protection/dp/B06XFSQFMW/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61559&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poetic Nubuck Credit Card Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Poetic-Nubuck-OnePlus-5-Case-press_0.jpg?itok=7UFpc1xQ&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect cases to keep our phone protected, but it's also nice when they can provide additional functionality, too. Check out the Poetic Nubuck case, which includes a card slot on the back for holding two cards — perhaps a credit card and your photo ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be able to quickly access your cards with the pull tab design. This case is made of a high-quality TPU shell that keeps your phone protected along with a synthetic leather backing over the card slot that combine to offer a unique look for your OnePlus 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the card slot, the Poetic Nubuck is still a fairly slim case and also affordable at just $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Credit-Poetic-Nubuck-Pull-Tab/dp/B07582KHYJ/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61559&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SUPCASE Unicord Beetle Pro Case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Supcase-oneplus-5-press_0.jpg?itok=HreAZpMc&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for something a little more on the rugged side? The Unicorn Beetle Pro provides front and back protection for your OnePlus 5, which also includes a durable swivel holster for quick-draw access at your side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the front, Supcase has included a built-in plastic screen protector that's surrounded by a thick rim to keep the display raised from flat surfaces. The case itself utilizes a shock-absorbent TPU and durable polycarbonate to protect your phone from harsh impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unicorn Beetle Pro's rugged design is great for enhancing grip, too, with plenty of texture on each side of the case. This protective bundle is only $18 and available from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-SUPCASE-Full-body-Holster-Protector/dp/B074KDDP6R/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61559&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Orzly FlexiCase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/06/oneplus-5-orzly-press.jpg?itok=z0MW3wJ5&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;899&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter lightbox right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a simple case to keep your OnePlus 5 protected, Orzly has got you covered. Their FlexiCase is made from flexible TPU material and is available in clear and black versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a really simple design, with the clear case offering that &quot;barely there&quot; look and feel. There are precise cutouts around the dual camera and flash setup, the alert slider, and the USB-C charging ports, while the power and volume buttons are covered but accessible. It's a great option if you're looking for a cheap, basic case for just $7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Case-Orzly-FlexiCase-Anti-Scratch/dp/B072MZCQB6/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61559&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Google Assistant not working when prompted through Bluetooth headphones on Pixel 2</title>

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]The hits keep on coming.

Poor Pixel 2. Whether it be display controversy with the XL model, clicking/hissing noises with its smaller brother, or defective microphones across both handsets, to say that Google's latest and greatest has been faced with a bit of trouble would be an understatement.



In addition to everything else that's already going on with the phone, it's now being reported that both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are having trouble getting the Google Assistant to work when its prompted through a pair of Bluetooth headphones that can summon it.

On affected devices, connecting Bluetooth headphones to a Pixel 2/2 XL and then pressing the button on your headphones to bring up the Assistant plays the regular tone or sound to let you know that it's listening, but for some unknown reason, voice detection straight up doesn't work.

Even worse, the issue appears to be all across the board &amp;ndash; affecting headphones from Beats, LG, Anker, and more. A community manager for the Pi...</description>

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]Once you go looking for Android launchers, it's hard to miss the legacy of Nova Launcher.



Nova Launcher has been around for over half a decade, and while scores of launchers have risen and fallen in that time, Nova Launcher is still at the front of the pack and getting more awesome every month. Nova Launcher is one of the best launchers on the market, it is the best launcher for theming.

There are a lot of reasons to love it, but here are some of our favorites.



It's the best launcher out there, free or paid



Nova Launcher inhabits a place that still hasn't quite been copied, mimicked, or overtaken by any other product, and it does this with three tentpoles that keep Nova Launcher's circus dazzling users. It's free to use but spending money for the premium version is worth every penny. Let us explain.

Although the Pixel 2 was the star of Google's October 4 hardware event, there were plenty of other gadgets and gizmos that the company had to show off &amp;ndash; one of which was the Pixel Buds. The Pixel Buds are Google's first shot at wireless headphones, and they're finally shipping out to those with early preorders.



Android Police first caught wind of this, and it looks like orders that were made on October 4 should arrive between November 16 and 17 (if not sooner depending on your location and the type of shipping that you chose).

The Just Black and Clearly White Pixel Buds are currently back in stock on the Google Store as well, each with a price of $159 and estimated to ship out in five or six weeks. As for the great-looking Kinda Blue option, this is unfortunately still sold out.

Between the unique design and real-time translation through Google Translate, the Pixel Buds are shaping up to be one of the more interesting wirele...</description>

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]Know who's at the door before the doorbell rings!

Is this deal for me?

The Ring Video Doorbells have become more popular over the past year, and there are several good reasons for that. If you're in the market for one, or have considered one but weren't sold on the pricing of it, today may be the day you make that purchase. Right now you can pick one up for $99.99 at Amazon and Best Buy.



This is one of the many items in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale, and those prices are scheduled to run through Saturday at Best Buy, though it may not last that long at Amazon.

From being able to see who is coming to your door to being able to interact with people who are in places that they shouldn't be right from your phone, there are lots of advantages to having a Ring Video Doorbell on the front of your home.



TL;DR

What excites us about this deal

Most of our posts come because an item hits a new low, but this is a really low price for this item. Previously, the low we saw on this was...</description>

<title>Deal: Jaybird Freedom wireless headphones are just $49</title>

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;The headphones usually cost $149&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Friday will be here before you know it, and while some sales will be reserved specifically for that day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thrifter.com/best-buy-black-friday-ad-scan#more&quot;&gt;there are a lot of deals&lt;/a&gt; that have already begun so you can start doing some early Christmas shopping right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Jaybird-Freedom-Header_0.jpg?itok=r_0QLKZV&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Buy is one retailer that's running early Black Friday sales, and one of the best ones we've seen so far is a $100 discount on the Jaybird Freedom wireless headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Freedoms usually cost $149, and while they aren't the newest wireless headphones around, it's hard to find anything to complain about with them for as little as $49. Jaybird promises 8-hours of battery life between the headphones themselves and the included battery pack, a sweat-resistant design is perfect for jamming out to your tunes while at the gym, and you have full control of your listening experience through Jaybird's MySound app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/Jaybird-Freedom-Best-Buy-Sale-November-2017_0.jpg?itok=ZkqV_wxu&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;531&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add all of this together with a sleek design, numerous wing and ear-tips to help you get the perfect fit, and a free carrying pouch, and the Jaybird Freedoms are a steal at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear just how long this deal will last, so we recommend jumping on it as soon as you can to make sure you don't miss out.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sphero Mini is the best $50 you can spend on your kids this year</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/1TuHl8005tE/sphero-mini-best-50-you-can-spend-your-kids-year</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/1TuHl8005tE/sphero-mini-best-50-you-can-spend-your-kids-year</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;I'm loving this little ball of fun, and at $50, it's one of the best toys you can add to your (or your kid's) collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, my life has been consumed by a particular game that has nothing to do with an erstwhile plumber with a magical hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the game is a ball, a literal ball, that moves with the help of some innovative tech and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphero.spheromini&quot;&gt;a very cool Android app&lt;/a&gt;. It's Sphero Mini, a pint-sized version of the popular Sphero robot that has been delighting people for years. At $50, it's less than half the price of the regular version, and while it doesn't have the same overall capabilities and battery life, I've found it to be just as enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sphero-Mini-Blue-App-Controlled-Robot/dp/B072B6QVVW/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63870&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/sphero-mini-1.jpg?itok=U-oUs21g&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphero Mini is a small motorized sphere and uses magnets, sensors and a bunch of programmatic magic to respond to movement from a smartphone app. The Mini is considerably smaller than the mainline version, and as a result can zip through corners and under couches (and more easily annoy pets) than its larger counterpart ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who's it for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/sphero-mini-4.jpg?itok=kK9oB6Lp&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphero Mini is aimed at kids, and that's reinforced by its cutesy packaging, neon color options (blue, orange, green, pink, and one) and straightforward charging options. That guidance also extends to the app, which in addition to controlling the little sphere with a virtual joystick also encourages kids (and kids at heart) to use facial expressions to move the ball up, down, left, and right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What can you do with it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/sphero-mini-gif.gif?itok=Wfmc6H0Q&quot; width=&quot;507&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter right&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drive it! When I was young, I loved remote-control cars, and Sphero Mini is the next step in that gaming evolution. Instead of winding up a Matchbox Car and letting 'er rip, this little thing lets you ride around for around an hour on a full charge, doing tricks and smashing into things (or knocking down the small bowling pins that come in the box), which on their own is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's also three games included in the app, allowing you to use the Sphero as a controller to accomplish tasks. It's fun and rewarding, and teaches kids that there can be a physical element to virtual play. The company promises more games in the near future, too, which is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I heard you can program with it, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep! Sphero is interesting because it uses its robots to teach kids how to code using a simple-to-understand language and a familiar app-based interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Available through the Sphero Edu app, the idea is to help kids understand the basics of coding using macros and templates that make the Sphero perform tricks or recall an obstacle course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's the best $50 you can spend on your kids this year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/11/sphero-mini-6.jpg?itok=48NXY36p&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to lie — I've used the Sphero Mini a lot in recent weeks, but one of my favorite moments was giving it to my five-year-old niece and watching her go wild with it. From the ridiculous Face Drive feature (which isn't &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; but it's terribly fun) to the built-in games (with more to come) the Sphero Mini is great value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sphero-Mini-Blue-App-Controlled-Robot/dp/B072B6QVVW/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63870&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;It's not available in the U.S., but Canadians can now purchase a BB Motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://crackberry.com/blackberry-motion-now-available-through-sasktel-canada&quot;&gt;SaskTel was the first to go live with orders for the BlackBerry Motion in Canada&lt;/a&gt;, Bell, TELUS, and Koodo have now also got the all-new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-motion&quot;&gt;BlackBerry Motion&lt;/a&gt; added to their lineups.

<title>Take better photos with the RevolCam lens accessory! </title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/e7P2D9gQYlA/take-better-photos-revolcam-lens-accessory</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/e7P2D9gQYlA/take-better-photos-revolcam-lens-accessory</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;We're reaching a point with smartphones where it's expected that all new releases come with a great camera. With nearly identical specs and comparable results, its easier than ever to take good photos with your phone — but if you want to take truly great photos you'll need some accessories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of photography accessories out there to choose from and it can be a bit overwhelming. Some of them are kind of clunky to use or they're crazy expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/medium/public/article_images/2017/11/RevolCam-stacksocial-press_0.jpg?itok=L1kc6At9&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-medium aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to step up your photography game without breaking the bank, you need the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitaloffers.androidcentral.com/sales/revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones?utm_source=androidcentral.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=revolcam-the-multi-lens-photo-revolution-for-smartphones_111017&amp;amp;utm_term=scsf-262038&amp;amp;utm_content=a0x1a000003aRTc&amp;amp;scsonar=1&quot;&gt;RevolCam multi-lens smartphone photography accessory&lt;/a&gt;. It's an all-in-one accessory that includes three lenses on a rotating rig along with an adjustable and detachable LED light for shooting in low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Samsung announces Exynos 9810 processor capable of gigabit LTE speeds</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/-Wql5tijIBU/samsung-announces-exynos-9810-processor-capable-gigabit-lte-speeds</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/-Wql5tijIBU/samsung-announces-exynos-9810-processor-capable-gigabit-lte-speeds</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;All new tech for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Samsung phones here in the U.S. are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, those same devices in other parts of the world feature Samsung's own Exynos silicon. The company &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-honored-for-outstanding-design-and-engineering-with-36-ces-2018-innovation-awards&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recently published a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the CES 2018 Innovation Awards that it's already won, and in doing so, quietly announced the all-new Exynos 9810 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/05/galaxy-s8-plus-review-9.jpg?itok=tkSBlKLl&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren't many technical details present here, but what we do know is that is that it features an upgraded CPU and GPU with support for gigabit LTE speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full description of the processor is as follows –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote readability=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exynos 9 Series 9810 is Samsung's latest flagship processor, with 3rd-generation custom CPU cores, upgraded GPU, and gigabit LTE modem with industry-first 6CA support. It is built on 2nd generation 10nm process technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigabit LTE is being pushed more and more heavily these days by carriers and processor manufacturers alike, and the 6CA technology in the 9810 will allow for downlink speeds up to a whopping 1.2Gbps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobiles-lte-advanced-network-now-live-over-920-markets&quot;&gt;Carriers certainly need to adapt and enhance their networks&lt;/a&gt; to allow for such increased data, but knowing that Samsung is already playing its cards right in these regards is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exact specifications likely won't be unveiled for the Exynos 9810 until CES 2018 this January, but when they are, we'll be sure to outline all of the important details to see just how it compares to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-and-qualcomm-said-be-working-galaxy-s9-processor-because-course-they-are&quot;&gt;Qualcomm's imminent Snapdragon 845&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;What's the thinnest case for Galaxy Note 8?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to protect your big ol' &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8&quot;&gt;Note 8&lt;/a&gt; with a case, but you don't have to give up the slim form factor in the process. These are the absolute thinnest cases we could find for Galaxy Note 8!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's almost like your phone is… &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bare-cases.com/products/bare-naked-for-galaxy-note-8&quot;&gt;Naked&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/bare-naked-note-8.jpg?itok=yGr7u5xf&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bare-cases.com/products/bare-naked-for-galaxy-note-8&quot;&gt;Bare cases&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; thin, and make your phone feel like it's wearing nothing at all… nothing at all… nothing at all. $30!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the vacuum of space, no one can see how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Crystal-Transparent-Protector-Samsung/dp/B07569QYLP/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;thin your case is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you can, down here with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Crystal-Transparent-Protector-Samsung/dp/B07569QYLP/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jupiter Lights case&lt;/a&gt; for $10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/spigen-thin-fit-note-8.jpg?itok=cYOLbQPO&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue, gold, black, or gray, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Galaxy-Surface-Excellent-Compatible/dp/B073R7DFG1/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;yours for $10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A case like skin for your phone — &lt;a href=&quot;https://buypeel.com/products/super-thin-galaxy-note8-case?variant=98720514067&quot;&gt;that's Peel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black, gray, or silver. Match it and &lt;a href=&quot;https://buypeel.com/products/super-thin-galaxy-note8-case?variant=98720514067&quot;&gt;grab it for $25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least that's what I'm guessing based on the hot dude in the promo image. Either way &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Myriann-Resistant-Protection-Lightweight-Protective/dp/B074WTL83W/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it's $10 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the store, but like the source of the phone. Like Samsung. Samsung makes this case. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note8-Protective-Orchid/dp/B074G8TPY3/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;$19 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding a thin case is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Perfect-Resistant-Excellent-Protective/dp/B0749C6MT1/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63865&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mSnap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black, turquoise, and rose gold because why not.

<title>Pixel 2 Driving Do Not Disturb API coming to developers in 2018</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/OwI_dYh5HUs/pixel-2-driving-do-not-disturb-api-coming-developers-2018</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/OwI_dYh5HUs/pixel-2-driving-do-not-disturb-api-coming-developers-2018</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Helping to silence notifications while on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can sometimes be quite easy to get lost in our phones, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with this, there are times and places where our devices need to put away. Picking up your phone to check notifications or browse through Twitter while driving can be awfully tempting at times, and Google is rolling out a new API next year to help cut back on these potential distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger_wm_brw/public/article_images/2017/10/google-pixel-2-car-dock-navigation-android-auto.jpg?itok=dEXs93Bd&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large_wm_brw aligncenter image-large&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the new features of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-2&quot;&gt;Pixel 2/2 XL&lt;/a&gt; is Driving Do Not Disturb. This is a setting that allows you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-pixel-2-will-automatically-enable-do-not-disturb-if-youre-driving&quot;&gt;automatically turn on Do Not Disturb when your Pixel 2 detects that you're behind the wheel&lt;/a&gt;, and the phone does this through the use of low power signals, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature is currently limited to Do Not Disturb settings for the Pixel 2, but beginning in early 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/11/making-pixel-better-for-drivers.html&quot;&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that it'll be releasing the API for this tech so that developers can integrate it into their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is calling it the Activity Recognition Transition API, and we'll likely see it adopted into navigation and safe driving apps that are meant to safely be used when on the road. A more specific ETA for the API's release has yet to be announced, but we can probably expect to see apps add the tech within Q1 of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-pixel-2-will-automatically-enable-do-not-disturb-if-youre-driving&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot;&gt;Google Pixel 2 will automatically enable Do Not Disturb if you're driving&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:title>Pixel 2 Driving Do Not Disturb API coming to developers in 2018</og:title>
<og:description>One feature Google introduced with the Pixel 2 is the option to have Do Not Disturb automatically turn on when you're driving, and the API for this tech will be made available to developers next year,</og:description>

<title>Essential Phone review re-do: What a difference a discount makes</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/tuMPcDgJcfU/essential-phone-review-re-do-what-difference-discount-makes</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/tuMPcDgJcfU/essential-phone-review-re-do-what-difference-discount-makes</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;I normally like to wait at least a year to give a smartphone the old &quot;review re-do&quot; treatment, but this is a special case. The Andy Rubin-led startup Essential changed everything when it slashed the price of its namesake flagship by $200 barely two months after launch, instantly instantly transforming the Essential Phone from an overpriced mobile with a terrible camera into a genuine bargain … with a terrible camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Essential Phone's optics remain a sore spot even after a 28% price cut – but as with most things Android, there's a hack for that. Let's find out if the deep discount combined with a little sideloading can make the PH-1 a late-season winner! Revisit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/essential-phone&quot;&gt;Android Central's Essential Phone review&lt;/a&gt; for some context, then hit up MrMobile's Essential Phone Review Re-Do for the November update!&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Get your lawn under control with the $69 Orbit B-hyve smart sprinkler system</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/j1il3kAAC5c/thrifter-deal-orbit-b-hyve-smart-sprinkler-controller</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/j1il3kAAC5c/thrifter-deal-orbit-b-hyve-smart-sprinkler-controller</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Don't let grass ruin your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D15HOIQ?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orbit B-hyve 6-station controller&lt;/a&gt; is down to $68.99 on Amazon. It normally sells around $100 and has never dropped this low before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-57950-12-Station-Sprinkler-Controller/dp/B01D15HOTU?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Orbit B-hyve 12-station smart sprinkler system controller&lt;/a&gt; is also on sale for $82.99. It regularly sells right around $120. It has seen a few drops close to $90 but those have all been temporary and never as low as this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/larger/public/article_images/2017/11/orbit-b-hyve-white.jpg?itok=oWm9xHL9&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-large aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the Rachio sprinkler controller, which is the market leader for these sort of devices. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Rachio-Sprinkler-Controller-Generation-Amazon/dp/B01D1NMLJU?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;8-zone Rachio&lt;/a&gt; is $200. You're getting a lot more value from the Orbit with 6 stations for $69. The Orbit has 4.5 stars based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-57950-12-Station-Sprinkler-Controller/product-reviews/B01D15HOTU?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;765 user reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The B-hyve app is fully functional for Android, iOS or web devices, and gives you control wherever you need it. Program your timer on the app, at the timer, or let the weather-based software create a program for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WeatherSense technology provides watering based on site conditions such as slope, soil type, sun/shade, forecast ET and live weather feeds. It automatically adjusts your controller to deliver the right amount of water to your plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize the swing panel for easy access to the angled wiring terminals, which makes wiring simple and convenient, and the plug-and-go line cord that can also be cut for hardwired applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in the USA with global materials, the B-hyve comes in a weather-resistant case, allowing you to mount your timer indoors or outdoors without risk of weather damage, and a locking cabinet that keeps your timer safe from harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate your B-hyve timer with use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-26250-Sprinkler-Catch-Cups/dp/B00CBZB8U8?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Catch Cups (Orbit 26250)&lt;/a&gt; to save up to 50% more water than with traditional controllers. Optimize the way you water, so you can keep everything lush and green without breaking the bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get an Alexa device like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-Black/dp/B01DFKC2SO?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Amazon Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt; to enable voice control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D15HOIQ?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU63902&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta shop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;See at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<og:description>This is the lowest price we've ever seen on this sprinkler controller. You'll need to get an Alexa device like the Echo Dot if you want to add voice control to your new sprinkler system.</og:description>

<title>Battle against your favorite characters in South Park Phone Destroyer [Best New Games]</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/KLvRl9WuCGk/best-new-games-releases-android</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/KLvRl9WuCGk/best-new-games-releases-android</guid>
<description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;What are the latest games worth checking out in the Google Play Store?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;update&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;: South Park Phone Destroyer is finally out and it's friggin' sweet! Also, we got two brand new sequels to beloved games: Monument Valley 2 and Words With Friends 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Park Phone Destroyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/nF6iNKjliUA?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-nf6inkjliua&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Park games of late have been on point. Combining the show's notoriously basic animation style and the advanced specs of modern consoles and phones, we're finally getting games that really feel like you're controlling the action in an episode. Mobile users get South Park: Phone Destroyer, a free-to-play real-time battling game featuring all the crazy characters from the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Park fans may remember that the show lampooned freemium mobile games pretty savagely a few seasons back. While it might seem a little two-faced to later release a freemium-style game for South Park, it's worth listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Sblwz3b8s&quot;&gt;Matt Stone and Trey Parker's commentary track from that episode&lt;/a&gt; where they talked pretty candidly about their thoughts on the freemium games released for other animated series like &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinyco.familyguy&quot;&gt;Family Guy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.simpsons4_na&quot;&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone Destroyer is significantly different than those city building titles. Instead, it offers card-cast battling action similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashroyale&quot;&gt;Clash Royale&lt;/a&gt; and frames it in a story where all the kids of South Park are playing an epic game of Cowboys and Indians (and pirates… and space aliens…). The core gameplay is quite polished with a single player campaign and PvP game modes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show's raunchy humor comes through in the character design and dialog (presented as an ongoing group chat with the kids), and while some of the jokes come across &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more crass when written in text for as opposed to being delivered by Cartman himself this is still an absolute must-play for any South Park fan — and just like the show, it's definitely not for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.dragonfire&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot;&gt;Download: South Park Phone Destroyer (Free w/IAPs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monument Valley 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/48tYRgj18IU?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-48tyrgj18iu&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief time as an iOS exclusive, Monument Valley 2 finally made its way to Android, and just like the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.monumentvalley&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Monument Valley&lt;/a&gt;, it's another mesmerizing mobile masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new adventure follows a mother and her child as they explore new architectural marvels featuring mind-bending puzzles. This game is all about messing with your perspective and solving puzzles that require you to altering the beautifully rendered environments. It's OK if you never played the original game as the stories are entirely unique… but if you love the sequel you'll definitely want to double back and played it, too, before because it's a fantastic game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's certainly in the conversation for the best game of the year, and well worth the $5 cost to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.monumentvalley2&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot;&gt;Download Monument Valley 2 ($4.99)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words With Friends 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/AL8ycSiVhCU?modestbranding=0&amp;amp;html5=1&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;autoplay=0&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;autohide=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;theme=dark&amp;amp;color=red&amp;amp;enablejsapi=1&quot; width=&quot;682&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;video-filter video-youtube vf-al8ycsivhcu&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;[embedded content]&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of sequels to widely popular games, there's a new sequel out to your mom's favorite mobile game: Words With Friends. Don't take that as me throwing shade towards Words With Friends — it's just got a wide appeal that's popular with people of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's new with Words With Friends 2? Zynga has completely redesigned the look and feel of the game while also adding a bunch of cool new game modes. There's Solo Challenge which pits you against iconic literary figures controlled by the CPU, from Jane Austen to the master wordsmith himself, William Shakespeare. Then there's Lightning Round which is a team-based mode where it's a race to get to 750 points. Each member of your team starts with their own board and you swap and add words to each other's board as fast as you can. Both of those modes seem to address the biggest gripe with the original game — waiting for your friend to finally play a word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a substantial update to a beloved game that'll likely lead to a whole bunch of Facebook invitations to play from friends and family, and does good work to further differentiate Words With Friends from Scrabble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.words3&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; title=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;cta large&quot;&gt;Download: Words With Friends 2 (Free w/IAPs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
