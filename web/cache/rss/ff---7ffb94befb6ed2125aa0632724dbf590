<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;These days, many antivirus companies are branching out and now sell VPNs, tweaking and cleaning software and various other services or applications. While you as a user might have no interest in anything else being offered apart from the free antivirus, the antivirus company is keen to make you aware that these other products exist. A few vendors have gone further and now put their free antivirus behind a launcher fronted that advertises their other products. Both AVG and Avira have gone down this route and when you click the tray or desktop icon for the antivirus it takes you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;One of the most important pieces of software you will use on your computer is going to be the web browser. There are really three main browser brand names, Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Internet Explorer/Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome/Chromium. There&amp;#8217;s also dozens of smaller third party browsers around to try out. Although Firefox and Chromium are both open source, the majority of third party browsers are based around Chromium and the Blink engine. Chromium is the browser project from Google that Chrome is based around. The two are very similar but Chrome is more like the public version as Chromium is never officially released as a&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

<title>5 Free Automatic Kill Switches for Unexpected VPN Disconnection</title>

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;If you think that you&amp;#8217;re the only user on your computer and nobody is watching what you&amp;#8217;re doing on the PC or what kind of websites you visit, you may be wrong because there is a possibility that your Internet Service Provider or the government is monitoring your online activities. More and more users are aware of the privacy risk and are willing to spend a little bit of money in subscribing to a VPN service to protect their privacy by encrypting the Internet connection. Once you&amp;#8217;re on a VPN connection, all your incoming and outgoing data is encrypted and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

When the battery runs out, you will start seeing error messages such as &amp;#8220;System CMOS checksum bad &amp;#8211; Default configuration used&amp;#8221; when starting up the computer and the date and time getting reset back to the default BIOS manufacturer date.

<description>[unable to retrieve full-text content]&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter what version of Windows you have, the best way to get your system working at its full speed and as issue free as possible is with a clean install of the operating system. Many small things can go wrong with your system over time which eventually will degrade performance and cause stability issues. Even with Windows 10, it&amp;#8217;s recommended to clean install after upgrading so you are not transferring any problems from your old Windows install onto your new one. It&amp;#8217;s relatively easy to get hold of a Windows 10 ISO image, burn it to DVD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

<title>10 Ad Blocking Extensions Tested for Best Performance</title>
<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RaymondccBlog/~3/YhTkw4UPt1I/</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RaymondccBlog/~3/YhTkw4UPt1I/</guid>
<description>&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adslot_1&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8102232298595506&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6560924694&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;horizontal&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking website adverts in web browsers has been a hot topic in recent years and there are merits to both sides of the argument. Many sites out there bombard you with tons of ads, and quite often you will feel that you have no choice but to use an ad blocker because either the ads slow down the site loading too much, or they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/identify-avoid-clicking-fake-download-buttons-file-hosting-sites/&quot;&gt;incredibly annoying and get in the way&lt;/a&gt; or distract from your browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, there are sites that try to inconvenience you as little as possible and be sensible with the amount of ads displayed and their placement. Blanket use of ad blockers will hurt those sites just as much as the bad sites you feel have gone overboard with their ads. It’s no secret the vast majority of websites on the internet need to use ads to help pay for running costs. Staff, hardware, fast servers, fast CDNs and the like are not free and need to be paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ad-blockers-test.png&quot; alt=&quot;ad-blockers-test&quot; width=&quot;696&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;But we cannot get away from the fact an ad blocker is probably the number one add-on for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/battle-of-the-browsers-in-cpu-and-memory-usage/&quot;&gt;browsers like Chrome and Firefox&lt;/a&gt;, and will continue to be so for some time yet. Besides removing the adverts, ad blockers also save bandwidth by cutting down the amount of content a page loads, they can also help with your privacy by blocking scripts that track your browsing habits. &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adslot_2&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8102232298595506&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8037657894&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  There’s several ad blocking extensions available for Chrome and Firefox, and some work better than others. To see what they do when when loading a web page, we’ve decided to put a number of ad blockers to the test. This test is about the performance of an ad blocker in terms of how quickly it loads a range of ad blocked pages, the maximum amount of memory it uses and how much stress it puts on the CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;h2&gt;The Ad Blockers on Test&lt;/h2&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more ad blockers available in Chrome than in Firefox which is the reverse of what we expected. Here are the ones we are testing for both browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3328/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdBlock for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; – The most popular ad blocker for Chrome with reportedly over 200 million downloads. There was a Firefox version released briefly but that was pulled from the Firefox add on pages for unknown reasons. AdBlock has acceptable ad options for YouTube and Google search but they are off by default.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;adblock&quot; width=&quot;304&quot; height=&quot;405&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3329/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdBlock Plus for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3330/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdBlock Plus for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – One of the most well known ad blockers and also one of the most controversial because AdBlock Plus started off the trend of introducing acceptable ad whitelists. The AdBlock Plus website also has versions for Opera, Safari, Maxthon, Internet Explorer and even Android.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adblock_plus.png&quot; alt=&quot;adblock plus&quot; width=&quot;277&quot; height=&quot;481&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3331/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdBlock Pro for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; – AdBlock Pro is based on AdBlock Plus but has a simpler options interface and no acceptable ads option. The icon button sits in the address bar instead of the normal add on area and has 3 simple options to disable, go to options or create a filter.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adblock_pro.png&quot; alt=&quot;adblock pro&quot; width=&quot;251&quot; height=&quot;134&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3332/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Adguard for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3333/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Adguard for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – Adguard is easy to use and extra blocking scripts can easily be added. Adguard’s main product is a shareware desktop application that blocks ads in a number of browsers without the need for browser add-ons. Beta versions of both add-ons are available for testers.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adguard.png&quot; alt=&quot;adguard&quot; width=&quot;366&quot; height=&quot;465&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3334/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;AdRemover for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; – AdRemover is based on AdBlock with just about the same number of options minus the support tab. On the face of it, most of the differences appear to be cosmetic and although it doesn’t ask for donations, there are social media buttons when clicking the icon.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adremover.png&quot; alt=&quot;adremover&quot; width=&quot;307&quot; height=&quot;484&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3335/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ghostery for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3336/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ghostery for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – Ghostery can block analytic scripts, widgets, web beacons, privacy scripts and or course advertisements. The good thing about Ghostery is the ability to individually enable or disable scripts on a per site basis. Versions are available for Opera, IE, Safari and mobile operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ghostery.png&quot; alt=&quot;ghostery&quot; width=&quot;373&quot; height=&quot;486&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3337/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Simply Block Ads! for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; – This hasn’t been updated since 2014 and there’s reports that some ads aren’t being blocked, but it blocked all ads on our test sites so we included it. Simply Block Ads! (aka Simple Adblock) is the easiest to use and the only option is an opt-in to send usage statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/simply_block_ads.png&quot; alt=&quot;simply_block_ads&quot; width=&quot;433&quot; height=&quot;266&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3338/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SuperBlock AdBlocker for Chrome&lt;/a&gt; – This is another AdBlock fork and appears to be by the same developer as AdRemover. Apart from an extra entry in the filter list and a few styling changes, we can’t see much difference between the two, perhaps there are more changes underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/superblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;superblock&quot; width=&quot;308&quot; height=&quot;445&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3339/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;µ Adblock for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – µ Adblock (Micro Adblock) is Easylist and EasyPrivacy based, and almost as easy as it gets. Simply click the icon to block/unblock specific sites. There are only 3 options including blocking social buttons. One issue is µ Adblock hasn’t been updated since January 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/uadblock.png&quot; alt=&quot;uadblock&quot; width=&quot;548&quot; height=&quot;450&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3340/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;µBlock Origin for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3341/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;µBlock Origin for Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – An up and coming ad and script blocker for both Chrome and Firefox, it also claims to be very CPU and memory efficient. A lot but not too many scripts are blocked out of the box and it’s easy to use with a number of other blocklists readily available. You can also allow or block specific sites from loading on the page via advanced mode.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ublock_origin.png&quot; alt=&quot;ublock origin&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;424&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Ad Blockers not tested&lt;/h2&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdBlock Edge&lt;/strong&gt; (Firefox) – The project has now been discontinued and the author recommends µBlock Origin instead.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdvertBan&lt;/strong&gt; (Firefox) – Hasn’t been updated since 2012 and inevitably leaves most or all ads untouched.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdBlock Lite&lt;/strong&gt; (Chrome and Firefox) – Left a number of ads untouched on our test sites, even in the more aggressive Full mode. Various sources say the project has all but been abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AdBlock Super&lt;/strong&gt; (Chrome) – After reading reviews and doing some testing we found that this addon actually injects ads of its own from a number of third parties. At best it’s adware, at worst it’s malware and should be avoided at all costs. Below are highlighted ads we received when visiting Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/adblock_super_adware.png&quot; alt=&quot;adblock super adware&quot; width=&quot;739&quot; height=&quot;403&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;µBlock&lt;/strong&gt; (Chrome and Firefox) – This version is essentially a clone of the original µBlock which was later renamed µBlock Origin. The author of µBlock Origin, Raymond Hill, has since disassociated himself from the µBlock branch and no longer contributes to the project. For these reasons we will test only µBlock Origin.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;h2&gt;How We Tested the Ad Blockers&lt;/h2&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Testing websites can be tricky because ads are served by third parties so a page is depending on external servers during loading. To try and even out any inconsistencies and also any differences with other servers being used by the website, each webpage tested was refreshed 10 times in succession and any times considered abnormal were discarded and the page refreshed again. Then we looked at 3 different scores:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Chrome:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page load time&lt;/strong&gt; – An average taken for the page to load 10 times. We are using the Load event to time when the browser has finished retrieving all the resources required by the page. In Chrome this is a red score on the Network tab in Developer Tools. Caching is disabled so resources are refreshed each time.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/chrome_load_event.png&quot; alt=&quot;chrome load event&quot; width=&quot;666&quot; height=&quot;182&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak memory usage&lt;/strong&gt; – We watched the memory usage of the ad blocker’s process in the Chrome Task Manager (Shift+Esc), the maximum amount of Megabytes used during the 10 page loads was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak CPU usage&lt;/strong&gt; – Similar to memory usage, using the Chrome Task Manager the maximum percentage of CPU usage was recorded during the 10 page loads.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/chrome_addon_cpu_memory.png&quot; alt=&quot;chrome addon cpu memory&quot; width=&quot;699&quot; height=&quot;321&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mozilla Firefox:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Page load time&lt;/strong&gt; – Average time taken for the page to load 10 times. Firefox doesn’t have a separate load event time in its Network tab like Chrome does, so we used an addon called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3342/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;app.telemetry Page Speed Monitor&lt;/a&gt; to get the times.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/firefox_page_speed.png&quot; alt=&quot;firefox page speed&quot; width=&quot;394&quot; height=&quot;434&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing about Firefox is you cannot get accurate scores for memory or CPU usage of extensions during use because unlike Chrome, everything is loaded into a single process. The about:memory page and a few related add ons don’t give a true live score for memory usage. As a result we could only record results for page load times in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Tests were conducted on a 4GB, Core Duo 2.2Ghz laptop using WiFi and running Windows 7 as the operating system. Although the tests could have been run on a more powerful system, we believe the laptop will produce more representative scores for the average computer.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;All ad blockers were installed and used with their default settings, nothing else was changed. The only exception is Ghostery which runs a wizard on startup where you need to choose what to block, for that we selected only the Advertising blocking option. Chrome 44 and Firefox 40 were the browsers used for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Next we’ll test 10 websites to see how the ad blockers perform.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;

<og:title>10 Ad Blocking Extensions Tested for Best Performance • Raymond.CC</og:title>
<og:description>Blocking advertisements on web pages is becoming increasingly popular and an ad blocker is now one of the most installed browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. To see how an ad blocker performs while blocking ads and how many resources it uses while doing so, we have decided to put several to the test.</og:description>

<title>5 System Rescue Boot Discs based on Windows PE</title>

<description>&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adslot_1&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8102232298595506&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;6560924694&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;horizontal&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boot disc is very useful because it can be used to perform troubleshooting tasks on an unbootable computer. Most of the time software that belongs in the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/top-10-free-data-recovery-software/&quot;&gt;data recovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/top-10-free-data-recovery-software/&quot;&gt;antivirus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/top-10-free-data-recovery-software/&quot;&gt;hard drive backup/restore&lt;/a&gt; provides the option to create a boot disc which is sometimes known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/13-antivirus-rescue-cds-software-compared-in-search-for-the-best-rescue-disk/&quot;&gt;rescue disc&lt;/a&gt;. Although these software can run from Windows, they are actually most efficient when run offline from a bootable disc.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;An example scenario is you’ve accidentally deleted an important file. You can of course install a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/restoring-accidentally-deleted-files-with-recuva/&quot;&gt;data recovery software such as Recuva&lt;/a&gt; and attempt to recover the deleted file. However installing it on the computer will face a potential risk of the installed program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/restoring-accidentally-deleted-files-with-recuva/&quot;&gt;overwriting the deleted file&lt;/a&gt;. To increase the chance of recovering the file, immediately shut down the computer, boot it up with a bootable WinPE disc and run Recuva from the Windows PE environment.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;A boot disc is normally based on either Linux or Windows PE. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/lili-the-pretty-and-easy-to-use-linux-live-usb-creator/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; is commonly being used because the operating system and most third party tools are free, the generated boot disc is more compact in size and can run on slower computers. As for Windows PE, it has the best hardware support and most users would be familiar with it such as the hard drive naming convention (C:\) in Windows compared to Linux (/dev/sda). However, Windows PE may have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/can-your-computer-meet-system-requirements-and-run-that-game/&quot;&gt;higher system requirement&lt;/a&gt; because the latest Windows PE 5.1 already need at least 512MB just for the base and adding more drivers, packages, or apps will obviously require more memory.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have a list of free boot discs based on Windows PE that come with a collection of useful tools which we think that every computer technician or even a normal user should have to hand. &lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle adslot_2&quot; data-ad-client=&quot;ca-pub-8102232298595506&quot; data-ad-slot=&quot;8037657894&quot; data-ad-format=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  1. &lt;strong&gt;Paragon Rescue Kit 14 Free Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Paragon Software is well known for their hard drive management software. Other than shareware, one of the freeware applications they offer is the Paragon Rescue Kit 14. It comes with a bunch of useful tools such as backup/restore to virtual disk, postmortem backup/restore, boot corrector to fix MBR/boot.ini/BCD/EFI boot parameters, undelete partition to restore partition that has been accidentally deleted, and file transfer. Unfortunately the registry editor and password cleaner to reset the local Windows user account is only available in Linux but not in Windows PE.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/paragon-rescue-kit-features.png&quot; width=&quot;674&quot; alt=&quot;paragon rescue kit features&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Paragon Rescue Kit 14 does not require Windows Automated Installation Kit nor Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit to build the recovery media if you’re creating from a Windows 7 or newer operating system. The builder will simply use the WIM image of the current operating system. However do take note that you will need to install WAIK or ADK if you want the builder to create the ISO image file.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;669&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/paragon-rescue-kit.png&quot; alt=&quot;paragon rescue kit&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;During the building process, you have the option to enable the advanced mode that allows to add storage and network device drivers, network configuration such as detecting the network interface automatically, and mounting a network share automatically after boot. You will also need to provide the product key and serial number which can be obtained for free &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;http://www.paragon-software.com/home/rk-free/registration.html&quot;&gt;at their official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3161/&quot;&gt;Download Paragon Rescue Kit 14 Free Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home Edition is free for non-commercial use only. It is able to create a Windows PE boot disc containing a few modules to help in recovering a crashed Windows by repairing boot errors, recover files after accidental deletion, cloning and creating disk image, recovering Windows serial number and resetting user account password.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;536&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lazesoft-recovery-suite.png&quot; alt=&quot;lazesoft recovery suite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Building a Windows PE with Lazesoft is as easy as clicking on the “Burn CD/USB Disk” button. You can choose to build a specific WinPE version ranging from Windows 7 to 8.1 for both 32-bit and 64-bit by clicking the Options button. The builder will automatically download the necessary components to build the WinPE if your computer does not have the files.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;586&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lazesoft-burn-cd-usb-disk.png&quot; alt=&quot;lazesoft burn cd usb disk&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows File Manager button found on the Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home Edition disc is not really a fully featured file manager like Windows Explorer where you have two tree view panes to easily manage files. You can however launch a third party file manager from the Windows Recovery button, go to the RepairTools tab and click on Lazesoft File Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;462&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/lazesoft-file-manager.png&quot; alt=&quot;lazesoft file manager&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3162/&quot;&gt;Download Lazesoft Recovery Suite Home Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;AOMEI PE Builder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;AOMEI Technology, the company that is well known for their PC backup software called Backupper, released a freeware program called PE Builder late last year to help users easily build a WinPE-based bootable media with just a few clicks. AOMEI PE Builder is able to build a Windows PE by using the Windows Recovery Environment that is found on newer version of the Windows operating system such as 7 and 8, so there is no need to download and install WAIK or ADK.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;482&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aomei-pe-builder.png&quot; alt=&quot;aomei pe builder&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows PE built by AOMEI PE Builder looks more like a normal Windows desktop because it comes with Windows desktop and Explorer which is not found in the Windows PE built by Paragon Rescue Kit or Lazesoft Recovery Suite. Other than that, AOMEI Backupper, AOMEI Partition Assistant and Windows Recovery Environment is included by default. You can also embed 3rd party portable tools such as 7-Zip, Everything, IrfanView, Notepad++, Q-Dir, Recuva, SumatraPDF, FileZilla, PENetwork, QTWeb, BOOTICE, NTPWEdit and OSFMount to the Windows PE by ticking the checkboxes. Custom drivers and files can also be added.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;678&quot; height=&quot;495&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/aomei-windows-pe.png&quot; alt=&quot;aomei windows pe&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Do take note that the current version 1.4 and all older versions might not build a working Windows PE and this is caused by some compatibility issues with the recent Windows updates released by Microsoft. If you urgently need to build a working Windows PE using AOMEI PE Builder, you can do it from a Windows 7 computer with the 2 Windows updates KB3022345 and KB3045999 uninstalled. This workaround only works in Windows 7 but not in Windows 8.1. AOMEI is aware of this issue and is currently working on a newer version to fix this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3163/&quot;&gt;Download AOMEI PE Builder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Gandalf’s Windows 8.1 PE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a pre-built Windows 8.1 PE, look no further and just use Gandalf’s Windows 8.1 PE because it is packed with useful programs. It has a desktop, explorer, start menu replacement with StartIsBack, compression tools, image viewer, hard drive tools, video player, OpenOffice, remote access tools (Ammyy Admin, Remote Desktop, TeamViewer), anti malware such as ClamWin and MalwareBytes, and many more!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;511&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gandalf-windows-81-pe.png&quot; alt=&quot;gandalf windows 8.1 pe&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Gandalf’s Windows 8.1 PE is 1.8GB in size and in an ISO image format. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/how-to-burn-images-on-a-cddvd/&quot;&gt;burn it to a DVD&lt;/a&gt; or install it to a USB flash drive using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/1110/&quot;&gt;Rufus&lt;/a&gt;. Both X86 and X64 versions of the 8.1 PE are available to download. All the tools embedded to Gandalf’s Windows 8.1 PE are either free or trial versions which means it’s free from pirated programs.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3164/&quot;&gt;Download Gandalf’s Windows 8.1 PE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;WinBuilder 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;WinBuilder 2015 is the new and completely rewritten tool of WinBuilder 082 which has not been updated since 2011. The old WinBuilder 082 comes in a nice graphical user interface with buttons and graphs while the latest WinBuilder 2015 runs in a simple window that accepts commands, similar to a command prompt. This new version of WinBuilder runs on Java which means it can also run on operating system other than Windows such as Linux and Mac OSX.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;684&quot; height=&quot;462&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/winbuilder.png&quot; alt=&quot;winbuilder 2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;The old WinBuilder 082 is supposedly easy enough to use involving only two steps but may be difficult to troubleshoot the problem if there are errors during the Windows PE building process. The new WinBuilder is even easier by typing a single command “AUTO” into the window, and the whole process of building a Windows PE bootable disc is fully automated including the downloading of the Windows ISO image file.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are 18 portable software tools that can be added to the Windows PE automatically through WinBuilder 2015 by typing the command “install appname” in the program. The plugins available to install can be listed by typing “&lt;strong&gt;install list&lt;/strong&gt;” in the program window. For example, to install Recuva, simply type “install recuva” in the window. Do note that there is no need to type the complete plugin name because the program accepts partial filenames.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;664&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/windowspe-winbuilder.png&quot; alt=&quot;windowspe winbuilder&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3165/&quot;&gt;Download WinBuilder 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Notes&lt;/strong&gt;: You can build a WinPE 5.1 which is based on Windows 8.1 using the old WinBuilder 082 through &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/download/did/3166/&quot;&gt;Win8.1SE&lt;/a&gt;. You will need to download the Windows 8.1 enterprise evaluation ISO, extract it to your hard drive or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raymond.cc/blog/10-free-software-to-mount-cd-or-dvd-iso-image-file-as-virtual-drives/&quot;&gt;mount the ISO to a drive letter&lt;/a&gt;, point the source directory to the extracted/mounted Windows 8.1 files, and click the Play button. Optionally, you can also change the configuration settings by enabling/disabling the scripts found at left hand navigation tree.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;674&quot; height=&quot;498&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://img.raymond.cc/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/win81se.png&quot; alt=&quot;win8.1se&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
