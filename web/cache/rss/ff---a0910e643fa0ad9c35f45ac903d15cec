<title>GameCredits Signs Deal with Unity Technologies to Bring Blockchain to Game Developers and Gamers</title>

<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://unity3d.com/company/public-relations/news/gamecredits-signs-deal-unity-technologies-bring-blockchain-game</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnership brings blockchain-based gaming ecosystem to the world’s most popular creation engine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belgrade, Serbia —&lt;/strong&gt; GameCredits, a Blockchain company driving innovation in the games industry, today announced the company has signed a deal with Unity Technologies, creator of the world’s most popular creation engine, that will bring the benefits of blockchain to more than 3 billion devices and millions of game developers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this deal, both companies will introduce novel forms of game distribution for the $100 billion* gaming industry, placing a particular focus on the fast-growing world of mobile gaming and eSports. GameCredits’ mobile game store, GPlay, will be integrated with Unity’s game-development ecosystem and developers will be able to effortlessly publish their games directly into GPlay. GPlay will share 90% of gross revenue (instead of the industry standard 70%), and will pay developers within 60 hours (instead of 60 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unity is known for aggressively adopting new technologies that democratize game development, solve hard problems and enable success for developers. With GameCredits, we intend to bring about a paradigm shift in the gaming industry. Blockchain solutions will help disintermediate game publishing and give better returns to creators,&quot; said Hubert Larenaudie, President Asia Pacific, Unity Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our partnership with Unity Technologies is a major step forward for both the gaming industry and the blockchain world. With GPlay and our eSport platform, we are bringing the benefits of blockchain and digital assets to the largest global audience yet, enabling true mainstream adoption of these technologies for the first time,” said Sergey Sholom, GameCredits CEO and GPlay President.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity exists to democratize development, solve hard problems and enable success -- three core values that are the driving forces of Unity’s adoption by millions of creators. Unity powers more than 50% of all new mobile games and over 2/3rds of all AR and VR content. Interactive content made with Unity reaches nearly 3 billion devices worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a record-breaking $53 million crowdsale earlier this year, GameCredits has been developing a suite of blockchain products for the gaming industry, all under its GPlay initiative. GameCredits recently joined Hyperledger, a Linux Foundation blockchain consortium whose members include IBM, Intel, Cisco, American Express, JP Morgan and other leaders from various industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GamesCredits will introduce its blockchain solutions at Unite the popular developers conferences in Melbourne, Singapore and India in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unity Technologies Debuts New Artist Tools and Innovations at SIGGRAPH 2017</title>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Timeline and Cinemachine empower artists to create more content in less time; new Photogrammetry technology provides powerful photorealistic tooling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2017 -- Unity Technologies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51597641&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170727005415&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=a85a46bd17f7703604630b7ee2d2f3a1&quot;&gt;https://unity3d.com/&lt;/a&gt;), the creator of the world’s most popular creation engine that reaches nearly 3 billion devices worldwide, announced today that it will give attendees at SIGGRAPH 2017 an in-depth look at its latest breakthroughs for artists and creatives in the world of interactive entertainment. As the leading provider of technical capabilities in the creative and artist space, Unity will be hosting several workshops and courses on topics including advances in real-time rendering and cinematic storytelling, as well as first-look deep dives for Photogrammetry and 2D Tilemapper. Artists can add these two new solutions into their workflow, giving them the power to unlock the full potential of their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity launched Unity 2017.1 earlier in the month. The launch signifies the start of a new cycle that evolves the world’s most popular game engine into an ever-expanding creation engine for gaming and real-time entertainment. The release features 100 new updates, including the powerful art and design tools that will be demoed at SIGGRAPH 2017, Timeline and Cinemachine, which allow artists to create cinematic content and gameplay sequences without the need for coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unity is not only the world's most popular gaming engine, it's also the world's most powerful creation engine. Amongst the new features in Unity 2017.1 are powerful professional grade tools that are accessible to creators of all types and sizes,” said Adam Myhill, Head of Cinematics, Unity. “At SIGGRAPH we'll be demonstrating how these tools allow for the big teams to be more productive and for the little teams to punch above their weight. Best of all - this flexibility allows teams the license to delay creative decisions until later in the process without taking too many risks. This new workflow will improve the quality of those creations, and give creatives the room they need to experiment -- we feel that it’s going to be a game changer for the artist community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located at South Hall Booth #417 in the Los Angeles Convention Center, Unity will be holding demos of the powerful new artist tools, courses on advancements in real-time rendering, and workshops on cinematics and storytelling from August 1 - 3. Attendees can also stop by the booth to receive a 10% off coupon to a Unity subscription. Additionally, several Made with Unity titles including the award-winning “Zero Days VR” will be on display during SIGGRAPH 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Unity Technologies Partners with Lionsgate to Create First-of-its-Kind Interactive Virtual Reality Advertisement for Upcoming Theatrical Film Release of Jigsaw</title>
<link>https://unity3d.com/company/public-relations/news/unity-technologies-partners-lionsgate-create-first-its-kind</link>

<description>&lt;h3&gt;New VR Virtual Room standard to be accessible in virtual reality apps made with Unity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO July 12, 2017 --&lt;/strong&gt; Today Unity Technologies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51587607&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170712005450&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=72d61a7e1d05ce592412cc52602ea43d&quot;&gt;https://unity3d.com/&lt;/a&gt;), the leading creation engine for gaming and interactive entertainment, announced a partnership with global content company Lionsgate (NYSE: LGF.A, LGF.B) to deliver the first-of-its-kind virtual reality (VR) advertisement for the mass market release of Jigsaw, the newest film in Lionsgate's blockbuster Saw horror film series. Saw is one of the highest-grossing horror franchises of all time with $873 million at the worldwide box office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on Unity, the new interactive ad format will be a “Virtual Room,” available for surfacing in any existing VR apps also made with Unity. This heart-pumping shortform VR experience will give players the ability to interact with objects as they learn more about the new film, and ultimately decide how to save themselves from impending doom. The Jigsaw VR “Virtual Room” was created within the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) emerging ad experience guidelines, and will launch this fall, prior to Lionsgate's global theatrical release of the film on October 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diehard franchise fans and new horror buffs alike are in store for a truly visceral and entertainment experience that’s sure to thrill,” said Lionsgate's SVP of Digital Marketing, David Edwards. “As big believers in the power of immersive storytelling, we are incredibly excited to bring Jigsaw into the world of VR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Unity, we want to redefine how people consume advertising, and are thrilled to have a visionary studio like Lionsgate take this leap forward with us,” said Agatha Bochenek, Head of Mobile and VR/AR Advertising at Unity Technologies. “To grow this emerging form of advertising entertainment, we are taking the guesswork out of the biggest hurdles in a new medium -- production and distribution. Our goal is to enable advertisers to build high-quality, engaging content quickly which will create memorable experiences, and can seamlessly reach users across all VR platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing compelling advertising experiences to VR is a natural next step for Unity -- the platform accounts for creating more than 2/3rds of VR content today. Within non-VR mobile apps, Unity serves as the largest independent ad platform in mobile games, reaching more than one billion users per month. This new wave of interactive advertising content will be brought to the world through the power of the Unity engine. As the VR medium continues to develop, advertising will offer a new way for Unity developers to monetize content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jigsaw VR “Virtual Room” is a pilot program, intended to showcase Unity’s capabilities to bring fully engaging VR ads the world.

<description>&lt;h3&gt;World’s most popular gaming engine radically increases productivity and collaboration between artists, designers, and developers with powerful new visual tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 11, 2017 --&lt;/strong&gt; Unity Technologies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51586825&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170711005806&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=1b416dd60670fa4ed4e2231a989e7e0f&quot;&gt;https://unity3d.com/&lt;/a&gt;) announced today that Unity 2017.1 is now available to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.unity.com%2Fdownload&amp;amp;esheet=51586825&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170711005806&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=download&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=c9bf548e01543e88ca75046414fe3be7&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; from the Unity Store. Unity 2017.1 is the start of a new cycle that evolves the world’s most popular game engine into an ever-expanding creation engine for gaming and real-time entertainment. Unity 2017.1, which is the company’s first fully subscription-based product, focuses on helping teams work together more collaboratively by equipping artists and designers with two powerful new visual tools: Timeline and Cinemachine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity exists to democratize development, solve hard problems and enable success -- three core values that are the driving forces of Unity’s adoption by millions of creators. Unity powers more than 50% of all new mobile games and nearly 75% of all AR and VR content. Interactive content made with Unity reaches nearly 3 billion devices worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unity 2017.1 is a one-stop creation powerhouse that will allow teams of artists and designers to unlock their full creativity. With incredibly open choreography tools like Timeline, smart procedural cameras in Cinemachine which follow your direction, and a built-in world-class colour grading suite plus the ability to edit and output all from within, we’re unleashing a content creation game changer that will improve collaboration across the board,” said Adam Myhill, Head of Cinematics, Unity. “Working in an environment with so much power and flexibility doesn't just save a huge amount of time, it allows you to experiment, iterate and collaborate in ways which are the key ingredients of so many great things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity 2017.1 contains more than 100 new features and improvements devoted to increasing collaboration, improving runtime performance and graphics quality, and more. Key highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul readability=&quot;12&quot;&gt;&lt;li readability=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline and Cinemachine:&lt;/strong&gt; New world-class artist tools Timeline and Cinemachine empower artists to &lt;strong&gt;create cinematic content and gameplay sequences without the need for coding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Timeline allows artists to easily blend and tweak animations within Unity, allowing for freedom to experiment and refine their creations. Cinemachine optimizes the artist workflow and gives room for experimentation by eliminating hours of hand animation, camera programming, and revision by using smart cameras for shot composition in cinematic sequences and gameplay. Engineers can also easily integrate sequences created with Timeline through the powerful scripting API and extend Timeline with the Playable API to create custom track types. Everyone will benefit from these new creative tools as it gives them access to artist tools that are intuitive, powerful and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li readability=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-driven Live-Ops that tailors content to your audience:&lt;/strong&gt; Unity 2017.1 gives users the power to take action on insights using a suite of Live-Ops analytics tools. Remote Settings is a powerful new feature that gives users the ability to make changes to their games in real-time, all without deploying a new version. Underpinning this is Standard Events which gives teams a window into how players are using their creations so they can make adjustments that will optimize enjoyment. Teams can also further maximize their success with Unity 2017.1’s built-in revenue generation solutions, bringing more opportunities to creators to optimize the performance of their content.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li readability=&quot;11&quot;&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A robust ecosystem that accelerates time-to-market:&lt;/strong&gt; Unity’s robust and ever-growing ecosystem accelerates time-to-market and decreases production costs through the Unity Asset Store, a massive catalog of free and paid off-the-shelf content created by the community, for the community. The Asset Store’s all-new redesign is rolling out this summer and is home to art, models, scripts, sound effects, editor extensions, productivity tools, and more — anything an individual creator or team might need to make development easier and get their project to the finish line faster. Custom work and additional collaborators can be sourced through Unity Connect, the professional network and talent marketplace for all Unity Creators.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;

&lt;p&gt;Unity 2017.1 subscription plans are available with enhanced features and services to support customers’ individual needs: &lt;strong&gt;Unity Pro&lt;/strong&gt; represents the top of the line in professional-grade tools while &lt;strong&gt;Unity Plus&lt;/strong&gt; offers serious creators who intend to publish additional tools and services to help them be successful. Custom-tailored enterprise solutions are also available for teams of 21 or more. For hobbyists and aspiring creators, &lt;strong&gt;Unity Personal&lt;/strong&gt; provides all the core features they need to get started for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All plans are royalty-free and include all platforms — complete details are available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.unity.com%2F%3F_ga%3D2.35259684.462587262.1499360577-102062906.1495043625&amp;amp;esheet=51586825&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170711005806&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Unity%27s+website&amp;amp;index=4&amp;amp;md5=32b65f0e3a4560973cb31be388355b00&quot;&gt;Unity’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Adhering to the notion that everyone should have the right to create, the Unity Without Borders initiative hosts nearly 40 developers from ten countries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp;amp; AMSTERDAM, June 26, 2017 --&lt;/strong&gt; Today Unity Technologies (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51580351&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170626006063&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=0529b576c8a419a863fe93b2e3ac34d4&quot;&gt;https://unity3d.com/&lt;/a&gt;), the leading creation engine for gaming and interactive entertainment, announced it will sponsor nearly 40 developers from ten different countries as part of the company’s Unity Without Borders initiative. Developers from countries such as Iran, Turkey, Libya and Cameroon will embark on a sponsored trip to Unity Europe: a global conference that will showcase technology industry insights, provide certification opportunities, and serve as a networking space for more than 1,500 Unity creators in Amsterdam from June 27-29. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fopen%3Fid%3D0B2BSMlW-2fSKNjUxMmZiRmVONTg&amp;amp;esheet=51580351&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170626006063&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=A+Unity+Without+Borders+video+can+be+found+here&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=f94ed2ad9e95859eb08f6c255c2465bb&quot;&gt;A Unity Without Borders video can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At Unity we believe that everyone -- regardless of background, perspective or nationality -- should have the right to create. Recent travel restrictions and discrimination against certain nationalities have impeded the global collaboration, learning, and progress that is vital to our industry and its continued success,” said Elizabeth Brown, Chief People Officer, Unity Technologies. “It’s our belief that, in order for a community to thrive, it must be open to people from all walks of life. We are honored to bring nearly 40 developers from ten different countries to Unite Europe for an opportunity to interact with the best and brightest minds in development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unite Europe will feature three days of more than 60 expert talks, instructional demos, and curated panels and will serve as a networking space for Unity creators. Unity will unveil new tools in Unity 2017.1 that will empower teams of artists and developers to build rich experiences together. The launch of 2017.1 signifies the evolution of the world’s most popular game engine into an ever-expanding creation system for gaming and real-life entertainment. The launch aims to equip artists, designers and developers with new, powerful visual tools that allow teams to contribute more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;h3&gt;Joins Facebook, Google, and others in a two-day Unity event bringing leaders together for insight and networking May 1-2 in Los Angeles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN FRANCISCO,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; April 13, 2017 --&lt;/strong&gt; Today &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funity3d.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51540652&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170413005762&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Unity+Technologies&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=41da2404386688f18c3ac67318b214f0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unity Technologies&lt;/a&gt; announced additional keynote and session speakers for next month’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvisionsummit2017.com%2F&amp;amp;esheet=51540652&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170413005762&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Vision+VR%2FAR+Summit+2017&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=0ddbfe73adad3bbd7216ab13ddf06841&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vision VR/AR Summit 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Preeminent author and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Victor Luo, NFL Films’ Jason Weber, Facebook’s Rachel Franklin, and many more will take to the stage for dynamic talks that explore the cross-industry applications of XR technology, best practices, and practical problem-solving. Vision Summit takes place May 1-2, 2017 in Los Angeles. A limited number of event tickets are still available. &lt;a href=&quot;http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FZ-4n3ZjH9C8&amp;amp;esheet=51540652&amp;amp;newsitemid=20170413005762&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=Check+out+this+video+of+what+to+expect+at+Vision+VR%2FAR+Summit+2017&amp;amp;index=3&amp;amp;md5=292ad83a02d6b1a30ed32bc671db105c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Check out this video of what to expect at Vision VR/AR Summit 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening keynote guest speaker Dawkins will introduce a new talk titled, “Constrained Virtual Reality: A Technology That is Millions of Years Old.” He will take a sidelong look at VR from the point of view of an evolutionary biologist. Vision Summit attendees will also be among the first to hear news from industry leaders and keynote participants Nathan Martz, Product Manager, Google; Jay Wright, President, Vuforia and Brandon Bray, Principal Group Manager, Microsoft, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we see is a model world, constructed by the brain in much the same way as VR software works in the computer. An animal’s world model is constructed to help it survive. A bat, using echoes, and a swallow using light, need the same kind of world model: suitable for high-speed aerobatics catching insects. Do bats even hear in colour? Our perception of reality is a virtual model run by software in the brain, constrained by sensory inputs,” said Richard Dawkins. “That’s what I’m excited to explore in my talk at the Vision Summit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity recently announced the XR Foundation Toolkit, a framework for XR developers and artists to get up-to-speed as quickly as possible creating immersive experiences. Oculus, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, and Daydream are currently working with Unity Labs and XR to make content more dynamic than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“XR has quickly become a defining way to do business, entertain, educate, and inspire,” said Tony Parisi, Head of VR/AR Strategy, Unity Technologies. “While we’re still in the industry’s earliest days, it’s events like Vision Summit that bring together established and budding professionals, the brightest minds, and a powerful network of peers to learn about and discuss key trends that are essential to advancing our practice, and the industry overall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the keynote, attendees can enjoy two days of session programming designed to expand core skills and inspire creative applications of XR technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session speakers include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jay Wright, President &amp;amp; GM (Vuforia)&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;

<link>https://unity3d.com/company/public-relations/news/unity-announces-upcoming-releases-56-and-unity-2017-beta</link>
<guid isPermaLink="true" >https://unity3d.com/company/public-relations/news/unity-announces-upcoming-releases-56-and-unity-2017-beta</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unity Technologies Special Keynote, GDC 2017, San Francisco -- February 28, 2017&lt;/strong&gt; -- Today at GDC &lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/&quot;&gt;Unity Technologies&lt;/a&gt; announced that Unity 5.6 will release on March 31, 2017, marking the final installment of Unity 5. The company also provided an early look at Unity 2017, the next generation of Unity with version 2017.1 Beta arriving in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Unity 5 cycle culminating in 5.6 represents great progress in our key focus areas: graphics, performance, stability, efficiency and platform growth. I’m really proud of what our engineering teams delivered,” said John Riccitiello, CEO, Unity Technologies. “Features like Physically Based Rendering, Global Illumination, and Codeless IAP are just a few of the advancements that have helped make Unity 5, and the community it powers, so successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key new features available in Unity 5.6 include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Progressive Lightmapper speeds up iteration and testing of lighting scenarios and reduces baking times.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;Navigation Mesh system adds AI and pathfinding to more easily control character navigation through giant game worlds.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;New Video Player supports smooth 4K playback to provide immersive video and enable the creation of 360 video experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;Native support for Vulkan graphics API provides better performance across Windows, Tizen, and Android platforms, while consuming less device power.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;TextMesh Pro provides improved control of text formatting and layout through Advanced Text Rendering and is now available for free to users of 5.3+, with native Unity integration coming in Unity 2017.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at GDC, two Unity partners announced new opportunities for Unity creators seeking global distribution and discovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xiaomi, one of the top handset manufacturers and Android app stores in China, is now offering Western developers direct access to the Chinese market; interested developers can learn more in the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://unity.mi.com/&quot;&gt;Xiaomi-Unity Developer Portal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook announced Facebook Gameroom Premium support, inviting developers of premium games—like &lt;em&gt;The Eyes of Ara&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Skyhill&lt;/em&gt;—to bring their content to the PC gaming platform’s growing portfolio. For developers using Unity IAP to implement payments, the company also announced that Facebook payment support will be available in Unity 5.6.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Unity introduced Unity 2017, the next generation of Unity that will get new features and improvements across graphics, performance, stability, efficiency and platforms as well as a new dedicated focus area: artists and designers. To improve team productivity and collaboration for non-programmers, Unity 2017 will bring the start of a series of features designed specifically for artists and designers across disciplines, from technical artists, to lighting artists, animators and more. Beta signups will be available in April.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mobile Games Generated More Than $40 Billion in 2016</title>

<description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;First ever joint look at mobile, mobile VR and VR markets by SuperData Research and Unity Technologies shows the category equaling that of global box office sales during that time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York, NY February 1, 2017 –&lt;/strong&gt; The mobile games market generated $40.6 billion in worldwide revenue in 2016 – a sum equivalent to all global box office sales during the same time period – and grew 18% over the year before. Mobile games now account for half of the entire global digital games market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;That’s according to a report, “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The 2016 Mobile Games Market” issued today by SuperData Research, the leading provider of marketing intelligence for the playable media and digital gaming industry, and Unity Technologies, the leading platform for creating games and experiences in 2D, 3D, VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The analysis, which examines the combined mobile, mobile VR and VR markets, is the first to be issued jointly by the two companies and is based upon data from both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“The sustained growth of the global mobile games market is helping to legitimize games in the traditional media landscape,” says Stephanie Llamas, VP of Research and Strategy of SuperData Research. “The size of the market is also attracting the leading players in the gaming market, as can be seen with Activision’s Blizzard deal to buy King and Tencent acquiring Supercell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;According to the analysis by SuperData Research and Unity, Asia represents the largest mobile games market in the world, producing $24.8 billion in revenue in 2016, while North America and Europe generated $6.9 billion and $5.7 billion respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;The ever growing US mobile market also represents a tremendous opportunity for marketers, as now Americans play mobile game more often than they watch Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube. Americans spent 5% more year over year on mobile games in 2016, and that number will continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;“Players are installing more apps than ever and are more engaged with mobile games than TV and online videos,” shared John Cheng, General Manager of Unity Analytics. “They play six days a week and watch content only five. It’s been phenomenal to watch engagement on the different mobile and VR platforms grow, and that trend will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;From Q1 to Q4, the time spent on mobile games grew by 12% on iOS and 9% on Android respectively, with gamers averaging almost 30 minutes of play time each day. As consumers continue to spend more time playing on mobile devices, the companies expect mobile gaming will continue to make strides towards the mainstream, giving marketers and developers an even greater opportunity to monetize this trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Additional findings from the report include:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;58% of mobile gamers play puzzle games, compared to 40% who play action games and 26% who play simulation games&lt;/strong&gt;. Puzzle games don’t require high-level graphics and are ripe for on-the-go play.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, action games represent 30% of the share of game installs by genre, while puzzle games represent 14%.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike puzzle games, action games are quick to play through, and retain players at 70% the rate that puzzle games do.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. is the only country with more players on iOS than Android.&lt;/strong&gt; Android gamers represent 78% of the global market, but iOS continues to yield higher spending overall.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the U.S., developers made on average 45% more on a player using iOS over Android, but in China, Android players were worth eight times more than iOS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indonesia tripled its potential for advertisers, seeing a 192% increase in installs in 2016.&lt;/strong&gt; Spenders also play 84% more than the average Indian player, creating an undeniable opportunity for developers.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users engaged with VR more often than they did with games, movie, or TV.&lt;/strong&gt; Mobile VR users engaged in 48 sessions per month, while PC/console users engaged in 36 sessions per month.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total VR revenue in 2016 was $1.8B, with 6.3 million devices sold.&lt;/strong&gt; Samsung Gear VR came out as the leader with 4.5M devices sold due to a low barrier to entry as compared to high-price competitors like Oculus.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#13;
